## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm (or yarn)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you have it on GitHub):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
    Alternatively, if you've downloaded the project files, navigate to the project's root directory.

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application, typically on `http://localhost:9002` (as configured in `package.json`). Open this URL in your browser to see the app.

The Genkit development server (if you plan to work on AI flows) can be started separately:

```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```

In the project directory, you can run:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode with Turbopack.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the production server (after building).
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the project files using Next.js's built-in ESLint configuration.
*   `npm run typecheck`: Runs TypeScript to check for type errors.
*   `npm run genkit:dev`: Starts the Genkit development server.
*   `npm run genkit:watch`: Starts the Genkit development server with watch mode.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This Next.js application is well-suited for deployment on platforms like:
