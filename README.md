## 🍕 Custom Food-Themed Loading Spinner

ByteEat features a custom, animated pizza-slice spinner for a delightful, branded loading experience. This spinner appears:
- **Globally:** On initial load and every route transition (see `src/components/layout/GlobalLoadingOverlay.tsx`).
- **Per-Page:** On key pages via `loading.tsx` files (e.g., `src/app/menu/loading.tsx`).

**How it works:**
- The spinner is a React SVG component (`src/components/ui/FoodSpinner.tsx`) with smooth, custom CSS animation (`animate-spin-slow` in `globals.css`).
- The global overlay is a client component that detects route changes and overlays the spinner with a subtle dark background and blur.
- All animations are handled via Tailwind CSS and global CSS for maximum performance and SSR compatibility.

## 🖌️ UI/UX Polish & Performance
- **Modern, accessible design** with Tailwind and ShadCN UI.
- **Custom animations** for loading, cards, and backgrounds (see `globals.css`).
- **Persistent cart** using localStorage.
- **Optimized images** and lazy loading for fast LCP.
- **No hydration mismatches:** All client/server boundaries are respected for smooth SSR/CSR.
